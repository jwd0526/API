## API Practice
This project was an effort to introduce myself to web-scraping, creating an API, and retrieving data from that API.


# csvToJson
This file converts a csv data into a json format. While not necessary for the purpose of the project, it was good practice.

# scraper
This file scrapes data from [https://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nba-basketball/](url), saves it as a csv, then uses csvToJson to save it as a json file.

# index
This file creates the API, with endpoints team, and odds, then accesses the api and prints the response to console.
